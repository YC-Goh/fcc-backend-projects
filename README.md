## What?

These are all clones of the files used for the [freeCodeCamp Back End Development and APIs module](https://www.freecodecamp.org/learn/back-end-development-and-apis) lessons.
Progress as follows:
- Managing packages with NPM: done.
- Basic Node and Express: done.
- MongoDB and Mongoose: done.
- Projects: In progress.

## Where backend?

Since GitHub Pages can only serve static files, the certification projects are necessarily hosted elsewhere.
In this case, they will not be hosted---once complete, the source code will committed to this repository and the [repl.it] for the corresponding project will be listed below.

I may consider instead hosting the backend for these projects on a service like Netlify in the future and serve the front-ends here using GitHub Pages.
